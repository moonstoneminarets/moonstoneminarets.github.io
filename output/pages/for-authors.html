<h2>What I am Looking For</h2>
<p>I'm looking for fiction for adult and young-adults, primarily novels. I will also consider short story collections and novellas. Genre and topic can cover anything in the diverse breadth of fantasy, science-fantasy, and science fiction; perhaps horror, or other genres, if they're good.</p>
<p>Content must meet my criteria for being "Islamically acceptable," which you can read about on the <a href="../pages/about.html">about page</a>. This is also subject to my discretion, as you might sometimes need to break the rules to deliver your book's message. It should also be between 60-700 pages in length.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not send your work until you feel it's ready to be published to the world!</strong> Due to time and resource limitations, I can only read it once, and I don't accept "updated" versions later on; you get one shot to make a great impression, so make it good!</p>
<h2>What I am not Looking For</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anything you didn't write or own the copyright to (obviously)</li>
<li>Non-Fiction, historical fiction, and other types of books (e.g. biographies, recipe books)</li>
<li>Books suitable for children 12 and under</li>
<li>Poetry</li>
<li>Anything not written in English</li>
<li>Anything you've already published elsewhere - digitally or in paper</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Offer</h2>
<p>Since Moonaret Minstones is a one-man project, I can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your book manuscript and report whether it meets our criteria</li>
<li>Review your book manuscript and provide broad, sweeping suggestions to make your writing more direct, concise, and impactful</li>
<li>Create a few cover options, and a final cover (using generative AIs)</li>
<li>Publish your book, as a paper book, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Barns &amp; Noble, Blackwells, etc.)</li>
<li>Publish your book, as a ebook, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Apple Store, Hoopla, etc.)</li>
<li>Publish your book to libraries (e.g. OverDrive/Libby, Odilo, Bibliotheca, Hoopla, etc.)</li>
<li>The option to update your book once every </li>
</ul>
<p>To see a complete and current list of stores, both digital and paper, check out our <a href="https://books2read.com/palestine">Facts About Palestine page</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, as the publisher, I acquire the rights to publish your book in print and ebook formats, worldwide, in all languages.</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>In exchange for my services, I keep <strong>20%</strong> of any profit the book makes <strong>(after expenses)</strong>. For example, if you publish a paperback on Amazon for $10:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon and the publishing platform take $8.29</li>
<li>The "gross" profit is $1.71</li>
<li>My cut is 20%, which is $0.34 (round down)</li>
<li>Your cut is 80%, which is $1.37 (round up)</li>
</ul>
<p>I pay you when I get paid, which is typically weeks to months after someone actually purchases the book (due to payment confirmations, waits for refunds, payout thresholds, etc.).</p>
<h2>Submission Process</h2>
<p>If you would like to proceed, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/5y4eq3tKYGK1RAym8">this form</a> to submit your final, complete, publishing-ready manuscript.</p>
<p>If another venue agrees to publish your work, which you submitted to me, congratulations! Please <a href="mailto:alibhai.ashiq@gmail.com">contact me</a> to withdraw your submission.</p>  </div>
