&lt;h2&gt;Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in the lively town of Noorville, lived two best friends: Abdurrahman, the fastest camel in the land, and Abdullah, the smartest falcon, with a Super Strong Prayer Mat that he could whirl like a spinning top to fly. They were known across the town for their bravery, kindness, and love for helping people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was one person they cared about most: their friend, Olive Master. Olive Master was a kind-hearted man who loved making the best olive pizzas in the Noorville town. He was famous for saying, "An olive pizza at iftar brings joy after!" But lately, Olive Master had been acting a little strange. He wore his pizza apron like a cape, spoke in rhymes, and sometimes forgot he was baking, leaving the pizzas in the oven for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think he’s been eating too many of his own pizzas,” Abdullah whispered to Abdurrahman one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman nodded. “Or maybe he’s just fasting and tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before they could figure it out, a loud BOOM! shook the town. Everyone ran outside to see the cause. Standing in the middle of the town square was none other than the villainous, mushroom-shaped troublemaker, Mushroom Head! He was wearing a ridiculous red cape covered in mushroom patterns, and in his hands was a giant vacuum-like machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hahaha!” Mushroom Head laughed. “People of Noorville, prepare to lose all your olives! I, the great powerful Mushroom Head, declare this town MUSHROOMVILLE! From now on, only mushrooms are allowed! No more olive pizzas! Hahaha!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people gasped in horror. No more olive pizzas?! And right before iftar?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Mushroom Head cackled even louder. “You weaklings fast all day and look forward to breaking your fast with your beloved olive pizzas, but now! THERE WILL BE NOTHING! No iftar, no energy, and no Taraweeh prayers for you! Without food, you’ll all be too tired to stand and pray! Mwahahahaha!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anyone could react, Mushroom Head pressed a button, and the vacuum sucked up all the olives from every bakery, every home, and—worst of all: Olive Master’s kitchen, where he was preparing the pizzas for the big community iftar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Noooooo!” Olive Master cried. “My precious olives! How will we break our fast without our beloved olive pizzas?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman and Abdullah exchanged glances. This was bad. Very bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have to stop him,” Abdullah said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman nodded. “But first, we need a plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two heroes rushed to their secret hideout (which was just a treehouse, but they called it a hideout because it sounded cooler). They knew Mushroom Head was no joke. He might look silly, but he had all kinds of wacky machines that caused serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay,” Abdullah said, drawing a plan on a piece of paper. “Step one: Find out where he’s keeping the olives. Step two: Sneak in and take them back. Step three: Stop Mushroom Head for good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sounds easy enough!” Abdurrahman said, stretching his legs. “Let’s go!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the two best friends dashed toward Mushroom Head’s lair, which was (unsurprisingly) shaped like a giant mushroom. Guards made of walking mushrooms stood outside, looking mean and bouncy at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman grinned. “This looks fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a burst of speed, he zoomed past the guards, making them spin like tops. Abdullah, using his Super Strong Prayer Mat, whirled it through the air, creating a gust of wind that knocked the remaining guards over like bowling pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nice work!” Abdurrahman said as they snuck inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside, the lair smelled... weird. Like old mushrooms and sadness. They tiptoed through long hallways until they found a giant storage room filled with—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Olives!” Abdullah whispered excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shh! We have to be quiet,” Abdurrahman reminded him. “Let’s take them back to Noorville before Mushroom Head notices!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before they could grab the olives, a deep voice echoed through the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“SO, YOU THINK YOU CAN STEAL BACK YOUR PRECIOUS OLIVES, HUH?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mushroom Head appeared, holding a remote control with a big red button. “You fools! With this button, I will turn every olive in this room into—MUSHROOM OLIVES!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olive Master, who had secretly followed them, gasped. “You MONSTER!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman and Abdullah had to act fast. Abdurrahman dashed toward Mushroom Head, trying to knock the remote out of his hands, but Mushroom Head dodged and pressed the button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BZZZT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A giant laser shot out, hitting the olives. They began to shake and change... but instead of turning into mushrooms, they grew LEGS and started running around the room, bumping into each other!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I may have miscalculated,” Mushroom Head mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman burst out laughing. “This is the best thing I’ve ever seen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running olives caused so much chaos that even Mushroom Head couldn’t stop them. While he was distracted, Olive Master grabbed a giant tray and started catching the runaway olives one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdullah spun his Super Strong Prayer Mat like a whirlwind, sweeping more olives into a giant sack. “We got them!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NOOOO!” Mushroom Head wailed. “MY PERFECT PLAN!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman smirked. “Sorry, Mushroom Head. Looks like Noorville stays an olive pizza town.” With that, he spun like a tornado and sent Mushroom Head flying out of his own lair, landing in a pile of squishy mushrooms outside. (Disgusting…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heroes rushed back to Noorville with the olives, and the town cheered. Olive Master hugged his tray of pizzas and sniffled. “I promise, from now on, I will never forget the most important thing in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdurrahman smiled. “What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sharing olive pizzas with my best friends at iftar and having the strength to pray Taraweeh together!” Olive Master said, passing out to everybody the beautiful pizzas with olives decorated on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town celebrated with a grand iftar feast, and even though Olive Master was still a little... strange, he was overall happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Mushroom Head? He was last seen in the forest, covered in mushrooms, muttering “the Olive Disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, with their friendship stronger than ever, Abdurrahman and Abdullah enjoyed another sweet (and savory) victory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="jannah-journeys"></category></entry><entry><title>The Little Lantern</title><link href="https://moonstoneminarets.github.io/the-little-lantern.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:moonstoneminarets.github.io,2025-01-14:/the-little-lantern.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two mountains, there was a tiny lantern named Noor. Noor lived in the village masjid, hanging high above the prayer mats. He was proud of his job, shining brightly during the night prayers and guiding the worshippers as they bowed and prostrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One chilly winter evening, the village imam climbed up to Noor and said, “Noor, the mountain path is very dark tonight, and there’s an old man travelling to our village. He needs light to find his way. Can you help?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noor was excited but nervous. He had never left the masjid before. “What if my light isn’t strong enough?” he whispered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imam smiled kindly. “Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. Do your best, and trust Him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those words, Noor felt a spark of courage. He was taken down from his usual spot, and a young boy named Yusuf carried him up the winding mountain path. The wind howled, and the snowflakes danced in the air, but Noor shone as brightly as he could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Look, Noor!” Yusuf exclaimed, pointing ahead. There was the old man, shivering and leaning on his cane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Assalamu alaikum!” Yusuf called out. “Follow us; we’ll guide you to safety!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old man smiled weakly. “Wa alaikum assalam. Thank you, my boy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they walked back down the path, Noor noticed how the old man stumbled. He thought, If only I could shine brighter to show him every rock and root! So Noor prayed silently, “Ya Allah, help me shine for him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Noor’s light grew warmer and brighter, cutting through the darkness like a golden thread. The old man’s steps grew steadier, and Yusuf smiled in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they reached the village, the old man turned to Yusuf and said, “You and your lantern saved me tonight. May Allah bless you both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the masjid, Noor hung proudly in his spot, his heart glowing with joy. He had learned something important: even the smallest light can make a big difference when it shines for Allah.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="jannah-journeys"></category></entry></feed>
