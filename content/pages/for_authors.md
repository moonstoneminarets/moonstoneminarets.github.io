Title: For Authors

Do you write books? Did you read our [About page]({filename}/pages/about.md) and find yourself nodding in agreement to our values? Then we might be the right publisher for you!

Since Moonaret Minstones is a one-man project, I can offer to:

- Review your book manuscript and report whether it meets our criteria
- Review your book manuscript and provide suggestions to make your writing more direct, concise, and impactful
- Create a few cover options, and a final cover (using generative AIs)
- Publish your book, as a paper book, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Barns & Noble, Blackwells, etc.)
- Publish your book, as a digital book, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Apple Store, Hoopla, etc.)
- Publish your book to libraries (e.g. OverDrive/Libby, Odilo, Bibliotheca, Hoopla, etc.)

To see a complete and current list of stores, both digital and paper, check out our [Facts About Palestine page](https://books2read.com/palestine).

In exchange, I keep 20% of any profit the book makes (after expenses). For example, if you publish a paperback on Amazon for $10:

- Amazon and the publishing platform take $8.29
- The "gross" profit is $1.71
- My cut is 20%, which is $0.34 (rounded down)

I pay you when I get paid, which is typically weeks to months after someone actually purchases the book (due to payout thresholds).

If you would like to proceed, please fill out [this form](#) to submit your work.
