Title: For Authors

## What I am Looking For

I'm looking for fiction for adult and young-adults, primarily novels. I will also consider short story collections and novellas. Genre and topic can cover anything in the diverse breadth of fantasy, science-fantasy, and science fiction; perhaps horror, or other genres, if they're good.

Content must meet my criteria for being "Islamically acceptable," which you can read about on the [about page]({filename}/pages/about.md). This is also subject to my discretion, as you might sometimes need to break the rules to deliver your book's message.

**Please do not send your work until you feel it's ready to be published to the world!** Due to time and resource limitations, I can only read it once, and I don't accept "updated" versions later on; you get one shot to make a great impression, so make it good!

## What I am not Looking For

- Anything you didn't write or own the copyright to (obviously)
- Non-Fiction, historical fiction, and other types of books (e.g. biographies, recipe books)
- Books suitable for children 12 and under
- Poetry
- Anything not written in English
- Anything you've already published elsewhere - digitally or in paper


## What I Offer 

Since Moonaret Minstones is a one-man project, I can offer:

- Review your book manuscript and report whether it meets our criteria
- Review your book manuscript and provide broad, sweeping suggestions to make your writing more direct, concise, and impactful
- Create a few cover options, and a final cover (using generative AIs)
- Publish your book, as a paper book, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Barns & Noble, Blackwells, etc.)
- Publish your book, as a ebook, to major bookstores (e.g. Amazon, Apple Store, Hoopla, etc.)
- Publish your book to libraries (e.g. OverDrive/Libby, Odilo, Bibliotheca, Hoopla, etc.)
- The option to update your book once every 

To see a complete and current list of stores, both digital and paper, check out our [Facts About Palestine page](https://books2read.com/palestine).

Note that, as the publisher, I acquire the rights to publish your book in print and ebook formats, worldwide, in all languages.

## Payment

In exchange for my services, I keep **20%** of any profit the book makes **(after expenses)**. For example, if you publish a paperback on Amazon for $10:

- Amazon and the publishing platform take $8.29
- The "gross" profit is $1.71
- My cut is 20%, which is $0.34 (round down)
- Your cut is 80%, which is $1.37 (round up)

I pay you when I get paid, which is typically weeks to months after someone actually purchases the book (due to payment confirmations, waits for refunds, payout thresholds, etc.).

If you would like to proceed, please fill out [this form](#) to submit your work.

If another venue agrees to publish your work, which you submitted to me, congratulations! Please [contact me](mailto:alibhai.ashiq@gmail.com) to withdraw your submission.
