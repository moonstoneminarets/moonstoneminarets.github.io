**A fallen knight. A forgotten curse. A sword that should not have been reforged.**

Once, he was **Sir Tariq ibn Rafi of Mirewood**, a squire to a noble hero, a warrior in training under the Crescent Banner—a man sworn to justice, to discipline, to the sacred code of the faith.

Then the spell hit.

His master fell.

And Tariq became something else.

**Cursed into the body of a frog**, he vanished from the world of knights and mosques, banners and vows. For years, he wandered the wilds, a beast of tooth and claw, a monster whispered of in border villages, a creature too broken to pray and too proud to die.

But rage doesn't burn forever. Not even in the hollow heart of a fallen knight.

When a strange mercenary named Brindle finds him in the swamp and speaks of an evil mage rising again—**Morvane**, the very sorceress who cursed him—Tariq sees his path.

To confront her, he must first **recover the broken sword Noorfang**, once wielded by his master. To wield it, he must survive the ruins of Emberglass. And to survive, he must decide whether he is still the man who once took an oath... or just the beast the world believes him to be.

He was trained to kill for justice.

He became a monster for vengeance.

Now, he must decide whether **mercy is weakness**. 

Or if it's the only way back to himself.
