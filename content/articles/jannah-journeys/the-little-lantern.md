## Text

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two mountains, there was a tiny lantern named Noor. Noor lived in the village masjid, hanging high above the prayer mats. He was proud of his job, shining brightly during the night prayers and guiding the worshippers as they bowed and prostrated.

One chilly winter evening, the village imam climbed up to Noor and said, “Noor, the mountain path is very dark tonight, and there’s an old man travelling to our village. He needs light to find his way. Can you help?”

Noor was excited but nervous. He had never left the masjid before. “What if my light isn’t strong enough?” he whispered.

The imam smiled kindly. “Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear. Do your best, and trust Him.”

With those words, Noor felt a spark of courage. He was taken down from his usual spot, and a young boy named Yusuf carried him up the winding mountain path. The wind howled, and the snowflakes danced in the air, but Noor shone as brightly as he could.

“Look, Noor!” Yusuf exclaimed, pointing ahead. There was the old man, shivering and leaning on his cane.

“Assalamu alaikum!” Yusuf called out. “Follow us; we’ll guide you to safety!”

The old man smiled weakly. “Wa alaikum assalam. Thank you, my boy.”

As they walked back down the path, Noor noticed how the old man stumbled. He thought, If only I could shine brighter to show him every rock and root! So Noor prayed silently, “Ya Allah, help me shine for him.”

Suddenly, Noor’s light grew warmer and brighter, cutting through the darkness like a golden thread. The old man’s steps grew steadier, and Yusuf smiled in wonder.

When they reached the village, the old man turned to Yusuf and said, “You and your lantern saved me tonight. May Allah bless you both.”

Back in the masjid, Noor hung proudly in his spot, his heart glowing with joy. He had learned something important: even the smallest light can make a big difference when it shines for Allah.
